Authors@R: c(person("Wenying", "Deng", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                     email = "wdeng@hsph.harvard.edu"),
              person("Jeremiah", "Liu", "Zhe", role = "ctb", "ths"))
Description: Using a library of base kernels, it learns a proper 
  generating function from data by directly minimizing the ensemble 
  model’s cross-validation error, therefore guaranteeing robust test 
  for a wide range of data-generating functions.
